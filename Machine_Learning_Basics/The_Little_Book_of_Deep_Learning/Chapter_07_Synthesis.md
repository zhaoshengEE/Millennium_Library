## Text Generation

- The standard approach is using an `attention-based, auto-regressive model`.
    - The most successful in this domain is the `GPT`
- `Large Language Model (LLM)`, tranined on very large datasets, is able to:
    - Understand the syntactic and grammatical structure of the language and
    - Integrate diverse knowledge


## Image Generation

- The powerful approach relies on inverting a `diffusion process`
