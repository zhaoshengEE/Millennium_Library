# What Is Generative AI


- `Generative AI` is designed to generate new content as its primary output.

- A `model` is a set of algorithms that have been trained on a specific dataset.

- With the emergence of `generative AI`, we are given the chance to discover the essence of *what is means to be a human (`consciousness`)* and *the true meaning of work (`vision`)*.


## Main Models

### Natural Language Model

- GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is notable for its
    - Large scale
    - Transformer architecture
    - Human-like text generation

### Text-to-Image Generation Services

| Services        | Operating System        |
| :-------:  | :-------:  |
| Midjourney | MacOS |
| DALL-E | Windows |
| Stable Diffusion | Linux |

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- `Generator` and `Discriminator` work together in a **competition** to improve the `Generator`'s ability ot create realistic data.

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

- VAE is used for `anomaly detection`
    - VAE is trained on a dataset of normal data
    - Later, VAE is used to identify instances that deviate from normal data
- A part of several other `Generative AI` models


## The Future of AI

- The objective of `generative AI` is to be a (creative) assistant to humans in their production workflow, instead of taking over humans.

- Plus, `generative AI` can be used to automate repetitive tasks and liberate humanity from dull, difficult, or robotic jobs.

- The center of all AI research and development shall be human creativity and human decision-making.
