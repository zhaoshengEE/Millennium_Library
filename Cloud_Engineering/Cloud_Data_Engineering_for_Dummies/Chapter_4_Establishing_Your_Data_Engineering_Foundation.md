# Chapter 4. Establishing Your Data Engineering Foundation

> Good data engineering requires a product mindset

`DataOps` (Data Operations) is used to describe the practices that automate the data engineering cycle.

`DataOps` needs to start with data governance as foundation. Then we need to consider the `lineage tracing`.

The `lineage` of data includes its origin, where it is used, who has access to it, and what changes have been made to it over time.

Data Engineers need to 
    - Have a foundation knowledge of waht modern clouds and big data consist of
    - Be proficient with programming languages such as `SQL`, `Java`, `Python`, or `Scala`
    - Understand differnet types of ingestion
        - Replication and streaming protocols such as `Kafka`
        - Processing frameworks such as `Spark` and `Flink`
