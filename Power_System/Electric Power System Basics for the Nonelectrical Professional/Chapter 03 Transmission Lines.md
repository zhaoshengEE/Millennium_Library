# Chapter 3. Transmission Lines


## High Voltage in Transmission Lines

- High-voltage transmission lines transport power long distances much more efficiently
- Increasing the voltage decreases the amount of current, given the same amount of power
    - Since current squared is the primarily factor in calculating power losses
    - The purpose of step-up transformers at power plants is to increase the voltage for power transport over long distances


## Overhead and Underground

- Underground transmission is usually 3-10 times costlier than overhead due to the right of way, obstacles, and material costs.  
- Underground transmission is normally used in urban areas or near airports where overhead is not an option.
